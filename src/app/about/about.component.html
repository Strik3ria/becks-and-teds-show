<h2>Meet Becks</h2>
<p>
    I am Becks, co-hosting Becks And Teds Show with my best friend for the last 40 years. It
    just seemed natural to do this show with Teds. I have a full-time job at a car dealership in
    the accounting office. I love to cook for my boys and use a lot of Pampered Chef products.
    Since I enjoy the Pampered Chef line of products, I decided it would be fun to stream live
    cooking segments that show the versatility of these products. If you are interested in
    purchasing any of the Pampered Chef products I use, please let me know through any of our
    social media sites. You can find links to them on the Social link above. I donâ€™t just cook,
    though! I am learning to paint, and you may just see some of that on the Show!
